# Codenames x MCP Demo

A visually rich and interactive walkthrough showcasing how **MCP (Memory-Context Processor)** transforms multi-turn decision-making and contextual reasoning, using the classic party game **Codenames** as a practical example.

## 🧠 What is MCP?

**MCP (Memory-Context Processor)** is a model-layer framework designed to provide AI systems with persistent memory, stateful reasoning, and long-horizon contextual awareness across multiple user interactions.

### ✅ Why was MCP developed?

Traditional LLMs, even the most advanced ones, treat every query as stateless. They forget prior conversation turns unless they're passed again, and they fail to truly "reason" over time.

MCP was developed to:

* Retain evolving **user goals and progress**
* Preserve a **timeline of decisions** and model responses
* Maintain **semantic and logical continuity** over a session

Imagine working with an AI that doesn't forget — that remembers your goal from turn 1, understands how turn 4 affects turn 7, and adjusts its logic based on what's already occurred. That's MCP.

> Think of MCP as a living memory layer for AI — like a whiteboard the model updates and reasons with across time.

---

## 🤔 Why this demo?

We needed a way to demonstrate how powerful MCP's persistent memory and logical continuity can be — especially in situations where history affects future decisions.

Enter **Codenames**: a game of clues, guesses, and progressive team reasoning. It's the perfect metaphor.

In a non-MCP system, the AI:

* Forgets previous clues
* Can't evaluate the game board's evolving state
* Makes isolated, non-contextual suggestions

With **MCP**, the AI:

* Tracks every move, clue, and guess
* Learns what worked and what failed
* Builds memory-informed reasoning chains
* Adjusts dynamically as context evolves

This demo visually and interactively shows that transformation.

## 🚦 MCP Toggle: Compare Modes

You can now toggle MCP ON or OFF using the "MCP: ON/OFF" button at the top of the demo.

- **MCP ON:**
  - See memory, deduction, and insights evolve turn-by-turn.
  - MCP tracks history, builds reasoning, and adapts.
- **MCP OFF:**
  - Experience a stateless AI: no memory, no deduction, no insights.
  - Each turn is isolated, with no context from previous moves.

This lets you instantly compare how MCP transforms multi-turn reasoning versus a traditional stateless approach.

## 👏 Credits

This project was created to illustrate how MCP makes even games smarter — let alone real-world decision-making flows.

Designed and developed by Jaydeep Shah, powered by OpenAI's architecture and guidance.

⚠️ Originally conceptualized as "Model Context Protocol," this project evolved to showcase the Memory-Context Processor—but the vision behind both remains aligned: multi-turn reasoning, state tracking, and dynamic contextual intelligence.
